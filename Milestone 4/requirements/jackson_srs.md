**Functional Requirements**

 - The system shall read input data from the keyboard.
 - The system shall allow users to open and read BasicML instruction files from their computer.
 - The system shall execute loaded BasicML instruction files, processing each command in sequence.
 - The system shall store input and output data in designated memory locations.
 - The system shall perform basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) on the accumulator.
 - The system shall allow branching to specific memory locations based on program conditions.
 - The system shall validate user input to ensure it contains only valid integers.
 - The system shall display file contents and execution results in the output window.
 - The system shall halt execution when it encounters a halt command in the BasicML file.
 - The system shall prompt the user for input whenever the BasicML program requires it.
 - The system shall display error messages for invalid memory locations or zero-division errors.
 - The system shall provide visual feedback for successful file loading and execution.
 - The system shall reset the accumulator and instruction pointer when a new file is loaded.
 - The system shall store user inputs in memory to be used by the current program.
 - The system shall present a GUI allowing users to load, run, and input data for a BasicML file.

**Non-Functional Requirements**

 - The system shall process user inputs and execute BasicML instructions within 1 second.
 - The system shall have a clear, intuitive interface with labeled buttons for opening and running files.
 - The system shall maintain consistent behavior without crashing, even when invalid inputs or files are provided.
